# TODO

* Pick a color scheme for cell hover, selecting cells, getting it right, and getting it wrong
* Build up a new word list using the Kaggle source
* Improve the completion screen
  * Nail down exact stats to show on the completion screen
* Make letter highlights less block-y
* Add settings to enable or disable profanity. Something local storage-y?

# TODO Later-er
* Make the homepage / new game page betterer, with an actual design and everything
* Start looking at the user flow
* Starting a new game should preclude words the user has already found within that day
  * Not set on the day length, maybe the half-hour to hour?
  * This could also be a setting that the user can configure
